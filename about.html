  <h1>About Me</h1>
<p class="lead">
  I’m Ezugwu Joshua Chukwuemeka, a Web Developer and Electrical Engineer based in Nsukka, Nigeria. I have a strong passion for building clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites that not only look great but also solve real-world problems.
  I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN), and I’m currently undergoing a Full-Stack Web Development course, having completed the frontend part (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap). I'm now diving into backend technologies like Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and more.
  Outside of web development, I’m also the founder of Joshchuks Tech Solutions, where I provide electrical services including house wiring, solar installation, CCTV setup, and general maintenance. This blend of hardware and software knowledge gives me a unique perspective in tech problem-solving.
  I’m currently focused on:
  Building powerful fintech and business web apps
  Growing my skills in full-stack development
  Delivering value through freelance and contract work
  When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me learning something new, sharing opportunities on LinkedIn, or working on electrical projects around Nsukka.
